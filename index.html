                </div>
                The most widely known measure of global happiness is the World Happiness Report, 
                which uses the Cantril ladder, also known as the "life satisfaction ladder," 
                as a primary indicator. The key components commonly considered in calculating the global 
                happiness score for a country include Life Satisfaction, GDP per Capita, Social Support Rate,
                Life Expectancy, Population and Freedom to Make Life Choices.

            <div><b style="font-size: 23px;">How useful is the Global Happiness Score?</b></div>
            Global happiness scores, such as those in the World Happiness Report, serve to guide
            policy decisions, enable international comparisons, assess public health, inform development 
            efforts, and study the relationship between well-being and economics. They have implications 
            for academic research, corporate social responsibility, and international diplomacy. Additionally,
            individuals use these scores to make decisions about where to live, work, or study, 
            but it's important to remember the subjective nature of happiness and consider them 
            alongside other indicators for a holistic well-being assessment.

                Countries with China as the most populated country in the world</b></div>
        The <b>top 10 countries</b> in the bar chart is visualized with
        <b>China</b> ranking at the <b>highest</b> position. This could be due to the social and 
        economic conditions in the early years. However, other factors such as fertility rates,
        parental care, education and infrastructure could also influence population of countries
        around the world.

            As we can see, the higher the happiness score within a country, the higher the 
            life expectancy of its people. <b>Europe</b> shows the <b>highest</b> happiness score and 
            life expectancy, whereas <b>Africa</b> shows the <b>least</b> happiness score and life expectancy.
        <b>Cuba</b> takes the top spot in <b>highest</b> life expectancy of <b>78.89 years</b>, and <b>Mozambique</b> is the last
        with lowest life expectancy of just <b>51.53 years</b>.
